# Agent Configuration Guide

Learn how to configure your AI trading agents through the web interface without any coding. This guide covers everything from basic setup to advanced agent personality configuration.

## üéØ What is Agent Configuration?

Agent configuration is how you teach your AI trading agents:
- **How to think** about markets (conservative vs aggressive)
- **What risks to take** (position sizes, stop losses)
- **When to trade** (market conditions, timeframes)
- **How to analyze** (technical indicators, AI models)

## üöÄ Quick Agent Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Access Agent Creation
1. **Go to your dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Click "Create Agent"** button (usually top-right)
3. **Choose setup method**:
   - **Use Template** (Recommended for beginners)
   - **Custom Setup** (For experienced users)

### Step 2: Choose Agent Template

#### Conservative Trader Template
```
‚úÖ Best for: Beginners, capital preservation
üìä Risk Level: Low (1-2% per trade)
‚è∞ Trading Style: Swing trading, trend following
üéØ Goal: Steady, consistent profits
```

#### Balanced Trader Template
```
‚úÖ Best for: Intermediate users, balanced approach
üìä Risk Level: Medium (2-3% per trade)
‚è∞ Trading Style: Day trading, multiple timeframes
üéØ Goal: Good returns with manageable risk
```

#### Aggressive Trader Template
```
‚úÖ Best for: Experienced users, higher returns
üìä Risk Level: High (3-5% per trade)
‚è∞ Trading Style: Scalping, high frequency
üéØ Goal: Maximum profits with higher risk
```

### Step 3: Basic Information
```
Agent Name: [Enter a memorable name]
Description: [Optional description of agent's purpose]
```

**Naming Tips**:
- Use descriptive names: "Conservative NQ Trader", "Scalping Bot 1"
- Avoid generic names: "Agent1", "Bot"
- Include strategy type: "Swing Trader", "Day Trader"

## üîß Configuration Validation

### Required Settings Checklist
- [ ] **Agent Name**: Unique, descriptive name
- [ ] **Trading Style**: Scalping, day trading, or swing trading
- [ ] **Risk Level**: Appropriate for your comfort level
- [ ] **Paper Trading**: ALWAYS enabled for new agents
- [ ] **Stop Loss**: Always configured (never trade without)
- [ ] **Position Size**: Appropriate for account size

### Safety Checks
- [ ] **Maximum loss per trade** ‚â§ 5% of account
- [ ] **Maximum daily loss** ‚â§ 10% of account  
- [ ] **Paper trading enabled** for testing
- [ ] **Stop loss configured** for all trades
- [ ] **Position size limits** set appropriately

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Confidence thresholds** not too high/low
- [ ] **Trade frequency** appropriate for strategy
- [ ] **Timeframes** aligned with trading style
- [ ] **Risk-reward ratio** minimum 2:1
- [ ] **Analysis methods** properly weighted

## üìã Configuration Best Practices

### Starting Configuration
1. **Always start conservative**: Lower risk, higher confidence thresholds
2. **Enable paper trading**: Test thoroughly before real money
3. **Use templates**: They're pre-configured for safety
4. **Start with single strategy**: Don't overcomplicate initially

### Gradual Optimization
1. **Run for 1-2 weeks**: Let agent establish baseline performance
2. **Analyze results**: Look at win rate, profit factor, drawdown
3. **Make small adjustments**: Change one parameter at a time
4. **Test changes**: Run for another week before more changes

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
‚ùå **Setting risk too high initially**
‚ùå **Changing multiple settings at once**
‚ùå **Not using stop losses**
‚ùå **Skipping paper trading phase**
‚ùå **Over-optimizing based on short-term results**

## üîÑ Managing Multiple Agents

    allocation: 20%              # 20% of capital
    risk_per_trade: 3%
    style: "scalping"
```

### Coordination Settings
```yaml
# Agent Coordination
coordination:
  prevent_overlap: true          # Prevent agents from taking same trades
  max_total_exposure: 10%        # Maximum combined portfolio exposure
  correlation_limits: 0.7        # Maximum correlation between agents

behavioral_metrics:
  rule_adherence: "> 95%"       # How well agent follows rules
  trade_frequency: "as_expected" # Trading frequency vs target
  confidence_accuracy: "> 70%"  # Confidence calibration
```

### Configuration Alerts
```yaml
# Alert Conditions
alerts:
  performance_degradation:       # If performance drops
    trigger: "profit_factor < 1.0"
    action: "pause_agent"

    trigger: "loss > max_daily_loss"
    action: "halt_trading"
    
  configuration_drift:           # If behavior changes unexpectedly
    trigger: "trade_frequency > 150% of target"
    action: "review_required"
```
